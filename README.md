# "Ovillo Feliz" knitting supplies website

## Description

This project is a web page for a ficticious online store that sells knitting and crocheting supplies. The entire project consists of a React frontend, a [NodeJS backend](https://github.com/aolivos15/P5-ecommerce-srv), and a MongoDB database. This repo is for the frontend, and it contains a home page, catalog pages for different types of products (yarn, thread, and accessories), and individual product pages. Users can select different colors and sizes for the products, and add the ones they want to a shopping cart. There is also a checkout section with PayPal buttons to simulate a purchase. Users can also create an account and sign in to the site.
